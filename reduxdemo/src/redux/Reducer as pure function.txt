what are pure functions?
--> 2 requirements
1. give same output each time for same input
2. dont produce any side effect i.e. don't produce any changes outside their scope

Side effect occurs anytime our functions interact with the outside world

Examples of side effect include
1. Making an API call
2. Mutating data
3. console logs to the screen
4. Manipulating the DOM
5. Date.now() to get current date/time
6. async await calls/waiting for promises to resolve
7. math.random() to generate random numbers

Benefits of Pure functions: 
1. Easy to test
2. Easy to debug
3. Memoization (by cacheing) is possible 

The most important feature of redux reducers is that, they are Pure Functions.

Reducers are pure functions that take in a state and action and return a new state.

function(state, action) => newState

Since Redux-Reducers are pure function we use thunk to perform API Calls/ network fetch effect
